# 📊 Decoding Superstore Sales — 6-Month Profit & Customer Insights Dashboard

### 🚀 Project Overview
This project analyzes **6 months of Superstore sales data (January–June 2015)** to uncover how customer segments, discounts, and regions influence profitability.

Although total sales appeared strong, management lacked visibility into:
- Which **customer segments** were truly driving profit.
- How **discounting strategies** affected margins.
- Which **regions or categories** contributed most to business performance.

This dashboard transforms raw data into actionable insights using **Power BI**.

## 🎯 Business Problem
The company had access to detailed sales records but struggled to:
- Identify its **most profitable customer groups**.  
- Understand the **impact of discounts** on profit.  
- Track performance across **regions and product categories**.  

Without these insights, data-driven decision-making was limited.

## 💡 Solution Approach
I developed a **two-page analytical storytelling dashboard** in **Power BI** designed to answer these key questions and guide better business strategies.

### **Page 1 – Sales Overview**
Provides a snapshot of business performance:
- **KPIs:** Total Sales, Orders, Profit, Quantity Sold  
- **Visuals:** Sales by Month, Region, Segment, and Category  
- **Story:** Highlights trends in sales and profit performance across the 6-month period.

### **Page 2 – Profit & Customer Insights**
Delves deeper into profitability patterns:
- **KPIs:** Average Order Value (AOV), Profit Margin %, Average Discount %, MoM Profit Growth  
- **Visuals:**
  - Profit Margin by Customer Segment  
  - Average Order Value by Region  
  - Discount vs Profit Scatter Plot  
  - Sales vs Profit Monthly Trend  
  - Top 10 Most Profitable Products
